## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at creating anything with css. I did some pre-reading on useful tools to familiarize myself with before jumping in and I settled on exploring CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Since this is my first forray into front-end development, I did have many training wheels in place. First was learning where to find the answers to my questions, and then when I struggled to formulate the right questions, I went to ChatGPT to help clearify what it was that I was really looking to accomplish.

### Continued development

I think an area of focus would be the proper way to structure CSS stylesheets as I feel the way I've organized my files does not feel optimal, or at a minimum, set up with very little thought.
